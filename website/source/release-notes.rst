Release notes
=============

cpp-verify follows `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org>`_. While the major
version is 0, a minor release (0.2.0) may change the contract language or the
meaning of a verdict, always with a migration path; a patch release (0.1.1)
fixes bugs and soundness issues without changing the language, and may move to
a newer point release of the same LLVM major. Moving to a new LLVM major
release changes what C++ the compiler accepts, so it takes a minor release.
``cpp-verify --version`` reports the release, the LLVM release it is built on,
and the backend versions. A build from ``main`` between releases reports the
next release with ``-dev``.

The data formats keep versions of their own, listed with each release.

0.1.0
-----

The first public release of cpp-verify: a Clang-based deductive verifier for a
documented subset of C++, with first-class contracts that Clang parses and
type-checks.

**Built on** LLVM 23.1.3. Z3 4.13.4 is built in. cvc5 (tested with 1.1.2) and
Lean 4.32.2 are optional and found on ``PATH``.

**Install.** Archives for Linux x86_64 and macOS arm64 are attached to the
release on GitHub; each holds ``cpp-verify``, ``clang``/``clang++``,
``clangd``, ``clang-format``, and Clang's headers. The macOS binaries are not
notarized; if macOS refuses to open one downloaded with a browser, run
``xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine`` on the unpacked directory. On other systems,
including Windows, build from source with ``setup.sh`` or ``setup.ps1``
(:doc:`index`).

**Language.** Every construct is written qualified, ``cppverify::pre(...)``,
or through an alias, ``cv::pre(...)``. ``-fverify-contracts`` includes
``<cppverify.h>`` implicitly and reserves no word, so every standard header
compiles. Sources in the earlier keyword syntax convert with
``clang/tools/cpp-verify/cppverify-migrate.py`` (:doc:`language/tooling`).

**Verification.** Function and loop contracts, spec and proof functions,
ghost code, quantifiers, ``cppverify::choose``, triggers, mathematical
collections, behaviors, inductive predicates, and automatic induction, over
integers, flat records, abstract buffers, scalar references, and constrained
pointer lifetimes. Backends: Z3 (default), cvc5, a strict Z3 and cvc5
portfolio, a race of both, bounded model checking, and Lean export and kernel
certification. On the solver backends ``Verified`` is a proof, a failure
(``error: verification failed``) is a counterexample checked against the true
definitions, and anything else is ``Unresolved`` with a reason. BMC reports
``BoundedSafe`` when no failure exists within its bound, Lean export
``Exported``, Lean certification ``Certified`` or ``Proved (z3+lean)``, and a
``[[cppverify::trusted]]`` contract ``Trusted``.

**Editors.** clangd from this release gives hover, go to definition, find
references, rename, and completion inside contracts, and clang-format lays
clauses out one per line (:doc:`language/tooling`).

**License.** cpp-verify, like LLVM, is distributed under the Apache License
v2.0 with LLVM Exceptions. Each archive includes ``LICENSE.TXT`` and, for the
built-in Z3, ``LICENSE-Z3.txt`` (MIT).

**Data formats.** Obligation archives ``cppverify.obligation/2`` (reads
``/1``), JSON diagnostics ``cppverify.diagnostic/1``, and semantic hash format
v4.

**Not yet verified.** Member functions, templates, floating point,
exceptions, lambdas, virtual dispatch, ``switch`` and range-``for``, and the
standard library's containers. Contracts on member functions are ignored with
a warning (``-Wcontract-unsupported``). A contracted function that uses one of
the others fails closed: the run stops with an error naming the construct and
reports no verdicts for the file. Contracts are not saved in precompiled
headers.
The full boundary is in :doc:`language/limitations`.
